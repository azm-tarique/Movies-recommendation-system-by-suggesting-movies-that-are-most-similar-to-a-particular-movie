# Movies-recommendation-system-by-suggesting-movies-that-are-most-similar-to-a-particular-movie
we will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies. Keep in mind, this is not a true robust recommendation system, to describe it more accurately,it just tells you what movies/items are most similar to your movie choice.
